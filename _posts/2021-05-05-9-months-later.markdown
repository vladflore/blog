...if you were thinking about screaming little humans, I am afraid I will disappoint you and it might be that this post is not for you.

If you are still reading, then you might be one of those people, who thought of something else what could have happened in a period of nine months. I salute you and encourage you to read on!

2020 was a special year, for the world and for me as well, on one side we had that _end of the world kind of global infestation_ thing, on the other side I managed to make some changes, which hopefully will pay-off in the near future, dare saying some of them have already payed-off.

As of 01.06.2020 I joined the club of those unemployed, a.k.a I left the company I had been working for the last 12 years of my life and decided to take a well deserved break from that _nine to five...ish_ lifestyle. I took that decision some time before the Coronavirus comfortably settled down to its new home...Europe, Germany.

Before you ask why I left the company after 12 years of employment, stay assured that's a whole new story, which might become a new [blog post]() in the near future. It suffices to say that after 12 years it kind of became clear what the future had in store for me and that _that_ wasn't compatible anymore with my aspirations.

At this point, you might think _ok, ok, no job, but definitely, already on the search for a new one, maybe even already employed, and if unemployed then definitely registered as such at the Federal Employment Agency, a.k.a, Bundesagentur für Arbeit, right?!?_. Well, no, and no!

To clarify the above a bit more, I didn't plan to immediately continue with working for a new employer, I did want to take time off and see to my own things, more on this a bit later on. As for the _gemeldet als arbeitslos_ and hence, I guess, benefit from money support from the state, I just wasn't interested in that hassle. I had some savings and I was willing to use those to cover the payments I still had to make, including the health insurance, the pension insurance and other living expenses. This was and is a valid, legal way of taking time off from work, albeit a bit expensive (stuff paid by the employer, becomes your responsibility), and the employment agency doesn't need to know about it, except for their statistics, but other than that...no earnings, no taxes, except for health and pension.

Now, on to what I meant with _take time off and see to my own things_, initially it was planned as a period of resetting, contemplating the future, learning new things, focus on physical exercising, getting in shape, exploring the world and just recharging with positive energy, energy others feasted on while I was employed. Well, karma had other plans for the world and such I was more or less confined to my apartment and had to rethink my new, well deserved _freedom_.

I am a software engineer, I have the computer science education (bachelor and master) behind me, and I have been working in the field of web development, with a focus on backend, for `1100` years ;). As such, spending time in front of the laptop and doing geeky stuff fits like a glove, reason why turning to my trustworthy laptop and start diving into all sorts of IT related subjects was as natural as it could be!

I already wrote a bit about what exactly this meant, have a look [at this post], but this time I'll go a bit further and offer some more insights. 

Now, I need to mention, that I am not an expert in any of the subjects I will be mentioning below, but I am familiar with them, with some more than with others. This kind of immersion into different subjects is not an easy thing to do, and it will not make you an expert, it would be childish to say the opposite, it __will__ broaden your knowledge though, maybe even deepen it, that's for sure, and this kind of horizontal expansion, as opposed to a vertical one, turned out to be exactly what I needed.

One more thing before going further, we, as software engineers, as __responsible__ software engineers, need to constantly learn and hone our engineering skills, we need to stay on top of this never-ending and always evolving field of IT, otherwise we risk becoming obsolete, which means, we risk becoming unemployed. There is another aspect here, it has to do with one's comfort zone, and the idea of finding something that works for you, never gets obsolete, and sticking with it until you retire. That could also work, but it is definitely not my style. More on this in [a future blog post]().

This being said, here are some of the things I tackled and dedicated some time and attention to.

#### Blogging

I (re-)started with blogging at the beginning of 2020, it involved some work and getting accustomed to some new tools, but after figuring all that out, it felt, and still does, kind of natural. Because the design muses were absent at my birth, I decided to go with a default theme/look/design, that I could use with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I bought myself a domain, connected it with GitHub and voilà...you can read my thoughts!

Btw, writing is a time-consuming process and doesn't work all the time, if you add in the fact that I have little time for it, or would it rather be bad time management?!, one could easily understand why the blog is sort of...rarefied.

#### Programming languages

Aah, yes, programming languages, you know, those languages you use to tell a computer what to do...there are plenty of them out there, and it is my intention to learn them all...just kidding, ain't going to do that, although it surely sounds appealing.

I personally started with Pascal, this was in high school, then continued with C, C++ and C++ - - a.k.a. Java, at the university. There were some other languages along the way, but in the end Java stuck to me and remained one of my to-go languages when I wanted to make my computer do something for me..., and it also pays the bills, so yay Java.

Other than that, my appetite for other languages kind of grew bigger, and such I learned some Python, gave JavaScript another chance, started with Kotlin (I am using it at my current job), learned some Julia...and was getting very confused when I was switching from one language to another.

Remember my to-go language, well, learned some more of it too, and got two certifications. This 25+ years old language is still in top 5 in the [TIOBE Programming Community index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) and its two releases per year cadence makes things a bit more challenging to keep up with it..., but you know, bills are kind of important... :) 

#### The art of writing code

You know how they say, we write code for humans not for computers. While this is true, not many of us, those bestowed with understanding computer programs, really get the gist of it, in the end that code is intended to be understood by computers, rather than by humans...which complicates things for other...wait for it...humans!
Writing code in that way that you can say _it is for humans_ is not necessarily an easy task to do, most of the time you get the algorithm working, it does what it is supposed to do, or at least it looks like it, and the next second you might think your job is done. NO! Your job is not done! Not by far, now you should make sure that the code is also written for you fellow programmers, colleagues or not.

There are all sorts of resources out there that can teach you how to properly write code, and I do not mean the syntax and how idiomatic your code is, while those are important aspects, obviously, there is more to writing code, than we might want to admit. It has to read like a poem, they say, it has to be a pleasure to work with. So __stop__ doing the following, and you will be way ahead of others:
* mutilate names
* use way too generic names for you functions and variables
* cram in lots of functionality into a class or method
* over-engineer code to the point the functionality you were implementing is not recognizable anymore
* being ignorant to the surroundings of where you are touching some code a.k.a leave the campground cleaner than you found it

Start with the above, and your fellow programmers will thank you.

#### Competitive programming

Another thing I had no idea it existed, is competitive programming, I remember watching a YouTube video of some guy solving problems and writing code faster
than I can write normal English text. I cannot recall anymore how I got there, but I know I liked it and something in my mind was keep bugging me to learn more about it,
and so I did.

The thing is, that you cannot _just start_ solving complex algorithmic problems, it requires months, maybe years of practice, and some serious algorithmic muscles.

All hyped as I was, I started looking around, googling about this thing, watching videos of others solving problems and took quite a serious interest into algorithms and data structures...
you kind of need them to be able to solve problems efficiently. There are lots of resources out there, one just needs the time, and the willingness to go through them.

Challenging yourself is a good thing, sometimes you will feel really smart, sometimes really dumb...just saying. Below are some online platforms where you can train/compete, and even make some money:

* [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
* [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
* [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
* [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
* [jetbrains academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/)
* [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)
* [codejam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam)

#### Algorithms and data structures

You may like it, or you may hate it, but you need them! Any self-respecting software engineer should know some basics algorithms and data structures and should be prepared to look them up
either online or in some CS textbook. Internet has no shortage of information on them and people have created entire businesses around them, plus if you want to work at one of the FAANG(Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) companies
you definitely need to be comfortable solving algorithmic problems.

Truth be told, if you do HTML and CSS you most likely do not need them, but as soon as you start writing code, you have to deal with algorithms,
maybe not with the complicated ones, but definitely with some common ones. In the end it depends on what you are doing as a software engineer.    

#### Getting comfortable with the command line

The cool kids use the command line not the graphical user interface! Now you know!

If you are still reading, know that getting comfortable with the command line is not an easy thing.
It has a lot of benefits and will make you look like a God. Imagine your fingers flying over the keyboard, text appearing in some transparent window, chunks of cryptic text flowing down,
you are in the flow, and the computer obeys your every single command you type in...life is good, and all of a sudden you misspell something, and the text becomes red, or your put an `-r` or 
`-f` or something similar, press `enter` and...boom...stuff gets uninstalled, deleted and...back to square one...installing the OS. 

I was just trying to highlight the fact that sometimes is better to just use the God damn mouse and click your way through all that. You will lose some popularity, but at least your files
are intact.

In my attempt to master the command line, I renounced at Windows, installed a fresh copy of Ubuntu and started...clicking my way through it, I am kidding, diligently typing in commands
and hopping for the best. You should give it a try too!

As you can see there was a lot going on, and as I said earlier, this didn't make me an expert in any of those fields, but it did broaden my knowledge and offered me some new views and takes on the complexity and beauty of software engineering.

Around the end of 2020 I started thinking about finding a new job, a remote one, not necessarily because of the Coronavirus, but rather because of the advantages and learning experiences it brings with. Finding a job is not an easy task, of course it's an experience more or less unique to every person, but it is definitely not a walk in the park. I might put together a [new post]() detailing my experience.

Fast-forward, 01.03.2021, new job, new position, and a feeling of accomplishment to accompany me for the foreseeable future.
