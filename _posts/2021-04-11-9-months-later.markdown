...if you were thinking about screaming little humans, you will now be deeply dissapointed and this post might not be for you.

If you are reading this line, then you might be one of those people, who thought of something else what could happend in a period of nine months. I salute you!

2020 was a special year, that goes without saying, but besides that _end of the world kind of global infestation_ there were some other aspects of my life, which provided me with some very important lessons.

Starting with 01.06.2020 I was unemployed, I left the company I worked for in the last 12 years of my life, and decided to take a well deserved break from that _nine to five...ish_ life style. I took that decission some time before the Coronavirus settled comfortably in Europe.

Before you ask why I left the company after 12 years of employment, well that's a whole new story, which might become a new [blog post]() in the near future. It suffices to say that after 12 years it kind of became clear what the future had in store for me and that wasn't compatible anymore with my aspirations.

At this point, you might think _ok, ok, no job, but definitely, already on the search for a new one and until then registered as unemployed at the Federal Employment Agency, a.k.a, Bundesagentur f√ºr Arbeit, right?!?_. Well, no, and no!

To clarify the above a bit more, I didn't plan to immediately continue with working for a new company, I did want to take that time off and see to my things, more on this a bit later on. As for the _gemeldet als arbeitslos_ and hence, I guess, benefit from money support from the state, I just wasn't interested in that hussle. I had some savings and I was willing to use those to cover the payments I still had to make, including the health insurance, the pension insurance and other living expenses. This was and is a valid, legal way of taking time off from work, albeit a bit expensive (stuff paid by the employer, becomes your responsability), and the employment agency doesn't need to know about it, except for their statistics, but other than that...no earnings, no taxes, except for health and pension.

Now, on to what I meant with _take time off and see to my things_, initially it was planned as a period of reseting, contemplating the future, learning new things, focus on physical exercising, getting in shape, exploring the world and just recharging with positive energy, energy which others feasted on while I was employed. Well, karma had other plans for the world and such I was more or less confined to my appartment and had to rethink my new, well deserved _freedom_.

I am a software engineer, I have the formal computer science education (bachelor and master) behind me and I have been working in the field of web development, with a focus on backend, for `1100` years ;). I mean to say that turning to my trustworty laptop and start diving into all sorts of IT related subjects was just a natural and kind of expected thing to do! Of course, besides going full geek mode, there were [some other things]() going on, but in this post I'll stick to _going full geek mode_.

I already wrote a bit about what exactly this meant, have a look [at this post], but in this one I will offer some after the fact kind of insights. 

I have to mention, that I am not an expert in any of the subjects I will be mentioning below, but I am familiar with them, with some more than with others. This kind of immersion in different subjects is not an easy thing to do and will not make an expert out of you, it would be childish to say the opposite, it __will__ broaden your knowledge though, maybe even deepen it, that's for sure, and this kind of horizontal expansion, as opposed to a vertical one, was exactly what I needed.

As software engineers, we need to stay up to date and always learn new stuff, otherwise we risk becoming obsolete, and when your skills are not important any more, this might get you into troubles, more on this in a [future post]().

This being said, here are some of the things I tackled and dedicated some time and attention to.

#### Blogging
#### Programming languages
#### The art of writing code
#### Coding challenges
#### Algorithms and data structures
#### Command line
#### Software design and architecture
#### Creating a portfolio / side projects
#### Frameworks for developing web applications
#### Cloud
#### Machine learning

As you can see there was a lot going on, and as I said earlier, this didn't make me an expert in any of those fields, but it did broaden my knowledge and offered me some new views and takes on the complexity and beauty of software engineering.

Around the end of the year I started looking for a new job, and let me just say this, it wasn't how I've imagined it would be. I am considering writing [a post]() about that experiece, because it deserves a post of its own.
