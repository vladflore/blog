Hello Internet,

so this is my first blog post, which I hope will be one of many more to come. This is more of a *hello world* kind of post, 
a way to cut my teeth into blogging and see if it's something I would like doing.

Should you wonder by now why *hello world*,
well just ask someone who works in IT and has learned at least one programming language.

The majority of the posts will be of technical nature and will server primarily the purpose of conveying knowledge
that I gathered or stumbled upon over the time.

Quite often I find myself in the position of having to do something I have already done
before, and quite often I regret not having documented that something...This blog is about changing all that and allowing me
and others to tap into that information I once used/had in order to make use of it again.

I guess time will tell if this was a worthwhile endeavor or not.

Happy reading,

Vlad
