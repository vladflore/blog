...if you were thinking about screaming little humans, I am afraid I will dissapoint you and it might be that this post is not for you.

If you are still reading, then you might be one of those people, who thought of something else what could have happend in a period of nine months. I salute you and encourage you to read on!

2020 was a special year, for the world and for me as well, on one side we had that _end of the world kind of global infestation_ thing, on the other side I managed to make some changes, which hopefully will pay-off in the near future, dare saying some of them have already payed-off.

As of 01.06.2020 I joined the club of those unemployed, a.k.a I left the company I had been working for the last 12 years of my life and decided to take a well deserved break from that _nine to five...ish_ life style. I took that decission some time before the Coronavirus comfortably settled down to its new home...Europe, Germany.

Before you ask why I left the company after 12 years of employment, let me just tell you that that's a whole new story, which might become a new [blog post]() in the near future. It suffices to say that after 12 years it kind of became clear what the future had in store for me and that _that_ wasn't compatible anymore with my aspirations.

At this point, you might think _ok, ok, no job, but definitely, already on the search for a new one, maybe even already employed, and if unemployed then definitely registered as such at the Federal Employment Agency, a.k.a, Bundesagentur f√ºr Arbeit, right?!?_. Well, no, and no!

To clarify the above a bit more, I didn't plan to immediately continue with working for a new employer, I did want to take time off and see to my own things, more on this a bit later on. As for the _gemeldet als arbeitslos_ and hence, I guess, benefit from money support from the state, I just wasn't interested in that hussle. I had some savings and I was willing to use those to cover the payments I still had to make, including the health insurance, the pension insurance and other living expenses. This was and is a valid, legal way of taking time off from work, albeit a bit expensive (stuff paid by the employer, becomes your responsability), and the employment agency doesn't need to know about it, except for their statistics, but other than that...no earnings, no taxes, except for health and pension.

Now, on to what I meant with _take time off and see to my own things_, initially it was planned as a period of reseting, contemplating the future, learning new things, focus on physical exercising, getting in shape, exploring the world and just recharging with positive energy, energy others feasted on while I was employed. Well, karma had other plans for the world and such I was more or less confined to my appartment and had to rethink my new, well deserved _freedom_.

I am a software engineer, I have the computer science education (bachelor and master) behind me and I have been working in the field of web development, with a focus on backend, for `1100` years ;). As such, spending time in front of the laptop and doing geeky stuff fits like a glove, reason why turning to my trustworty laptop and start diving into all sorts of IT related subjects was as natural as it could be!

I already wrote a bit about what exactly this meant, have a look [at this post], but this time I'll go a bit further and offer some more insights. 

Now, I need to mention, that I am not an expert in any of the subjects I will be mentioning below, but I am familiar with them, with some more than with others. This kind of immersion in different subjects is not an easy thing to do and will not make an expert out of you, it would be childish to say the opposite, it __will__ broaden your knowledge though, maybe even deepen it, that's for sure, and this kind of horizontal expansion, as opposed to a vertical one, turned out to be exactly what I needed.

One more thing before going further, we, as software engineers, as __responsible__ software engineers, need to constantly learn and hone our engineering skills, we need to stay on top of this never-ending and always evolving field of IT, otherwise we risk becoming obsolete, which means, we risk becoming unemployed. There is another aspect here, it has to do with ones comfort zone and the idea of finding something that works for you, never gets obsolete, and sticking with it until you go on pension. That could also work, but it is ndefinitely not my style. More on this in [a future blog post]().

This being said, here are some of the things I tackled and dedicated some time and attention to.

#### Blogging
#### Programming languages
#### The art of writing code
#### Coding challenges
#### Algorithms and data structures
#### Getting comfortable with the command line
#### Software design and architecture
#### Creating a portfolio / side projects
#### Frameworks for developing web applications
#### Cloud
#### Machine learning

As you can see there was a lot going on, and as I said earlier, this didn't make me an expert in any of those fields, but it did broaden my knowledge and offered me some new views and takes on the complexity and beauty of software engineering.

We are now approaching the third trimester of my nine months pause, and I was starting thinking about finding a new job, a remote one, not necessarily because of the Coronavirus, but rather because of the advantages and learning experiences it brings with. Finding a job, is not an easy task, but more on this in a soon to come [new post]().

Fast-forward, 01.03.2021, new job, new position and a feeling of accomplishment to accompany me for the foreseeable future.
