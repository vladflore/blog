title: Software Craftsmanship

Last year I had the opportunity to put together and hold a presentation at a conference organized
by the [company](https://www.virtual7.de/){:target="_blank"} I am currently working for. As you might have guessed from the post's title
it was a presentation about the **craftsmanship** behind **creating software**.

Creating software is no easy task, creating software **responsibly** is even harder, but this should not discourage one to do so.

By adhering to some healthy coding habits one can and will write code that will not make others cringe when looking at it.
Remember, _we write code for people not for computers_.

The presentation is powered by the [reveal.js framework](https://revealjs.com/#/){:target="_blank"} 
and it can be found at this [link on GitHub](https://vladflore.github.io/software-craftsmanship/#/){:target="_blank"}.
