Hi Internet,

this is Vlad writing.
I'm not that big on talking about myself, so I'm just gonna keep it short and to the point:

**Q:** Who are you, Vlad?

**A:** Just a man on this planet, currently living in Germany and working as a software engineer. Check my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vlad-flore-a709723b) and [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Vlad_Flore/cv) profiles should you want to learn more.

**Q:** Why a blog?

**A:** I always kinda wanted to have one, but I never had the time, or the inspiration, to put one together and keep it up to date.
Because I do not give up that easily, I said to myself it was time to give it another chance.

**Q:** What will you be blogging about?

**A:** Mainly about Information Technology (IT) and should the muses be on my side about life and co.
