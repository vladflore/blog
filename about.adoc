Hi Internet,

this is Vlad writing.
I'm not that big on talking about myself, so I'm just gonna keep it short and to the point:

**Q:** Who are you, Vlad?
{nbsp} +
**A:** Just a man on this planet, currently living in Germany and working as a software engineer.
Check my {Linkedin}[Linkedin] and {Xing}[Xing] profiles should you want to learn more.
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +
**Q:** Why a blog?
{nbsp} +
**A:** I always kinda wanted to have one, but I never had the time, or the inspiration, to put one together and keep it up to date.
Because I do not give up that easily, I said to myself it was time to give it another chance.
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +
**Q:** What will you be blogging about?
{nbsp} +
**A:** Mainly about Information Technology (IT) and should the muses be on my side about life and co.

Happy reading and c ya on the net! +
Vlad
