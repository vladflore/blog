Hi Internet,

this is Vlad writing.
I'm not that big on talking about myself, so I'm just gonna keep it short and to the point:

_**Q:**_ Who are you, Vlad?

_**A:**_ Just a man on this planet, currently living in Germany and working as a software engineer.
Check my [Linkedin][Linkedin] and [Xing][Xing] profiles should you want to learn more.

_**Q:**_ Why a blog?

_**A:**_ I always kinda wanted to have one, but I never had the time, or the inspiration, to put one together and keep it up to date.
Because I do not give up that easily, I said to myself it was time to give it another chance.

_**Q:**_ What will you be blogging about?

_**A:**_ Mainly about Information Technology (IT) / Computer Science (CS) and should the muses be on my side about life and co.

Happy reading and c ya on the net!

V.
