Hi Internet,

this is Vlad writing and welcome to my corner of Internet where I share things about **Software Engineering** in particular and **Computer Science** in general.

I'm not that big on talking about myself, so I'm just gonna keep it short and to the point:

_**Q:**_ Who are you, Vlad?

_**A:**_ Just a man on this planet, currently living in Germany and working as a software engineer.
I love learning new things and challenging myself with new endeavours, especially when it comes to Computer Science and Technology.
I also like travelling and exploring new places.

Check my [Linkedin][Linkedin]{:target="_blank"} (English) profile should you want to learn more about the professional Vlad.

Fell free to have a look at the [GitHub]{:target="_blank"} profile should you be interested into my commits.

_**Q:**_ Why a blog?

_**A:**_ I always wanted to have one, but I never had the time, or the inspiration, to put one together and keep it up to date.
Because I do not give up that easily, I said to myself it was time to give it another chance.

_**Q:**_ What will you be blogging about?

_**A:**_ Mainly about **Software Engineering** / **Computer Science** and should the muses be on my side about life and co.

Happy reading and c ya on the net!

V.
